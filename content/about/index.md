Owl started with the need of submitting data pipelines to a Kubernetes cluster by
research users, without the need to understand how Kubernetes works or indeed
any programming.

We built a set of parameterized pipelines that perform common tasks of data processing
and analysis and just by editing a defintion file containing parameters for each each pipelines
our users can run their jobs in a large cluster.

A description of how Owl (and many other utilities) is used in our project is available from the 
[IMAXT Documentation →](https://imaxt.github.io)


An article describing the infrastructure and pipelines that we run on it can be found in [The Imaging and Molecular Annotation of Xenografts and Tumours (IMAXT) High Throughput Data and Analysis Infrastructure →](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.22.448403v1)
