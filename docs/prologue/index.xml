The Owl Server is installed in the Kubernetes cluster and is in charge of receiving requests for jobs, allocating the necessary resources and running them. This consists of the scheduler itself and a lightway API that is used to communicate with the user.
The Owl Client runs in the user space (i.e. in any other system outside of the cluster) and is used to interact with the server, mainly to submit jobs and perform some administrative tasks.</description></item><item><title>Architecture</title><link>https://eddienko.github.io/owl-pipeline/docs/prologue/architecture/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 08:07:35 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://eddienko.github.io/owl-pipeline/docs/prologue/architecture/</guid><description>Introduction A job scheduler is an application that takes care of running unattended jobs in a compute cluster. Typically the scheduler will add jobs to a queue and run them when resources become available. Some widely used schedulers (mainly in HPC context) are Portable Batch System (PBS), Slurm Workload Manager, Condor, Moab, and many others.
In the context of cloud systems and in particular Kubernetes there is not a wide range of applications to run user submitted batch jobs.</description></item></channel></rss>
