The Owl Server is installed in the Kubernetes cluster and is in charge of receiving requests for jobs, allocating the necessary resources and running them.
The Owl Client runs in the user space (i.e. in any other system outside of the cluster) and is used to interact with the server, mainly to submit jobs and perform some administrative tasks.
Pre-Requisites ðŸ‘‰
