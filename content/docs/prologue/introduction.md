The Owl Scheduler is made from two different components. 
The [Owl Server]({{< relref "docs/server/introduction.md" >}}) is installed in the Kubernetes cluster and is in charge
of receiving requests for jobs, allocating the necessary resources and running them.

The [Owl Client]({{< relref "docs/client/introduction.md" >}}) runs in the user space
(i.e. in any other system outside of the cluster) and is used to interact with the server,
mainly to submit jobs and perform some administrative tasks.
## Pre-Requisites

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="You will need a running Kubernetes cluster." />}}

In order to install and run the scheduler you need access to a Kubernetes cluster. We have tried Owl in the following
versions:

* Kubernetes 1.21 (Docker Desktop)
* Kubernetes 1.22
